RawVisual



Version 7.0.0   Minimalist code, output. Raw bytes & their combos are searchable
                because nothing else is added to each,  so you can select lines.
                No \r char output;Linux & Mac use \n, Windows deny the standard.
                Added occurrences; bits 0,1. Speed improvements,  total rewrite.

Version 6.0.1   Universal drag-n-drop; gets path then fixes it if drag-n-dropped
                regardless of single-quote presence & "enter" not being cleared,
                meaning you can have options before it where user presses enter.

Version 6.0.0   Extraction mode! Retrieve original / partial file, directly from
                a -VISUAL.txt file. So you can share any file as  plaintext just
                by letting RawVisual create the analysis txt file. Now checks if
                path_to_file is bash-compliant so if bad characters are present,
                system() calls to hash are not made so you won't see errors. And
                You have the option to disable hash (slow for huge files.)

Version 5.0.0   Analyzed written to file only. Output dir: attempts dir of given
                file and if not allowed then writes analysis file to default dir
                (working dir.)Added "bytes_to_skip" so Bytes can be skipped, and
                "bytes_to_see" so only that  quantity  will be analyzed & saved.
                User may enter ridiculous values, there are catch-alls for that.
                Minimalist, simpler. These features  alone  allow you to see all
                Bytes, single Bytes, and intervals.  Added + edited ref in .cpp.

Version 4.0.0   Write ALL to file (live choice). Added checking: md5sum,sha1sum,
                sha256sum, and sha512sum.

Version 3.0.0   Loops your entry of: how many file Bytes to display, and whether
                you want to display them as int or actual, omitting non-standard
                since Android terminal corrups from special char even with sane.

Version 2.0.1   Adjusted comments for Android. ByteVisual.apk added. C4droid ok.
                Dec 12 2022

Version 2.0.0   Prints characters, \r, \n, \t next to occurrence for extra help.
